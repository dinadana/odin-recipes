    <p>This Middle Eastern-inspired shakshuka is a tomato-y one-skillet poached eggs dish that's full of all the flavors you expect from Middle Eastern recipes. Diced tomatoes, onions, and smoked peppers, plus cumin, chili powders and Spanish paprika. And together, they make this one hearty meal to feed a crowd from one skillet. Serve with pita bread.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil </li>
        <li>6 eggs, or more as needed</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>2 (14.5 ounce) cans Hunt's® Diced Tomatoes, undrained</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Spanish paprika </li> 
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground ancho chile powder </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chili powder </li>
        <li>pinch of salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in skillet over medium heat. Saute onions until translucent and tender, about 5 minutes. Add chopped roasted pepper and garlic; saute until garlic releases its fragrance, 1 or 2 minutes longer. Stir in tomato paste, chili powder and ancho chili powder, cumin, and paprika. Saute for another minute or so until well combined.</li>
        <li>Stir in Hunt's® Diced Tomatoes and water. Season with salt and pepper. Raise heat to medium-high and bring mixture to a boil. Immediately reduce heat to medium and cook about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium-low. Make a well for each egg and pour 1 egg into each well. Cover; poach until whites are firm and yolks have thickened but are not hard, 2 1/2 to 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
